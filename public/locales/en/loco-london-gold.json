    "p1": "Gold is one of the most sought-after commodities for investment purposes. Additionally, gold is used as a financial or economic standard, foreign exchange reserves, and the primary means of payment in several countries. Investors typically buy gold as a hedge or safe haven against various crises, including economic, political, social, or currency-based crises.",
    "p2": "The demand for physical gold has increased significantly from year to year, even though the world's gold reserves are very limited. Therefore, several developed countries have provided alternative investments in the form of gold derivative products by requiring a certain margin as transaction collateral (margin trading). This is due to price factors, as gold prices can also fluctuate like other commodities."

  "sejarah": {
    "title": "A. History of Gold Trading",
    "p1": "In commodity markets, the term \"Loco\" means \"in.\" It comes from the Latin word Locus, which means place. Loco London represents the international gold and silver trading and settlement base in London. This market operates under the auspices of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) but is not an exchange.",
    "p2": "The world's largest physical gold (spot gold) markets are in London and Zurich, with London being the most prominent. London came to dominate the gold market when gold became the primary currency. Significant discoveries in the Urals (Russia) increased global gold production in the 18th century. The mid-19th century marked a moment for Britain to dominate world trade and finance as a source of capital for gold mining and as the gold standard for the local currency, the British Pound. Thus, London became the center of world gold trading and settlement.",
